# gh-deployment-workflow

This repository demonstrates how to deploy a simple static website to **GitHub Pages** using **GitHub Actions**.

## 🚀 How it works
- Contains a simple `index.html` file.
- Uses a GitHub Actions workflow (`deploy.yml`) to deploy automatically.
- Every push to the `main` branch that changes `index.html` triggers deployment.

## 🌐 Live Site
Once deployed, the site will be available at:
https://<username>.github.io/gh-deployment-workflow/
